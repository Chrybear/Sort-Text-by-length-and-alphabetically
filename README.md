Homework 1 for CSC 499 at EKU
Sorts a textfile of words by their length and alphabetically.

**Instructions:**  
>Download the file "sortLenAlph.py".  
Put it into your desired folder/location.  
Add in a "txt" file with filename "Sort Me.txt" containing the words you wish to be sorted in the same folder/location you saved sortLenAlph.py.  
***Please Note: each word should be on its own line within the txt file***.     
Run sortLenAlph.py either via terminal/console or your perferred IDE.    
The program will run and print out the txt file in asending order of length and descending order alphabetically.    
If there is no file named "Sort Me.txt" in the same folder as the sortLenAlph.py file, the program will print out that it could not find the file.  





Test data: 
>There is a pre-made "Sort Me.txt" in the repository. To test the program, download it into the same location as you did sortLenAlph.py prior to running the program.

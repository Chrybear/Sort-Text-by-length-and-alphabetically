# Sort-Text-by-length-and-alphabetically
Homework 1 for CSC 499 at EKU
Sorts a textfile of words by their length and alphabetically.

**Instructions for branch 'main':**  
>Download the file "sortLenAlph.py".  
Put it into your desired folder/location.  
This program has only been tested with ".txt" files. Please put the txt files you wish to have sorted in the same folder/location you saved sortLenAlph.py.     
***Please Note: each word should be on its own line within the txt file***.     
Run sortLenAlph.py either via terminal/console or your perferred IDE.    
The program will run and ask you to enter the filename of the txt file you wish to be sorted in ascending order by length and descending order alphabetically.      
If there is no file name with the name you entered in the same folder as the sortLenAlph.py file, the program will print out that it could not find the file.  
***Please Note: only enter the filename of the file, not the file extension '.txt'***.  
After you have entered a valid filename, the system will print out the sorted words and ask you if you wish to have the new sorted words saved as a new txt file.  
If you select yes, the program will save the new sorted file as "'name you entered'_sorted.txt" in the same folder sortLenAlph.py is currently in.  
The program will then ask if you wish to enter another filename to be sorted.  
If you select yes, the process will start over. If you select no, the program will close.  

**Instructions for branch 'Reverse-Order':**  
>Clone this git repository to your personal computer using the command 'git clone https://github.com/Chrybear/Sort-Text-by-length-and-alphabetically'.  
Once downloaded, run the command 'git checkout Reverse-Order'.  
You will now be on the branch that has the functionality to do descending sort order.  
This program has only been tested with ".txt" files. Please put the txt files you wish to have sorted in the same folder/location you saved sortLenAlph.py.     
***Please Note: each word should be on its own line within the txt file***.     
Run sortLenAlph.py either via terminal/console or your perferred IDE.    
The program will run and ask you to enter the filename of the txt file you wish to be sorted.   
***Please Note: only enter the filename of the file, not the file extension '.txt'***.       
If there is no file name with the name you entered in the same folder as the sortLenAlph.py file, the program will print out that it could not find the file.  
The program will then ask what order you wish to sort the txt file in. Enter either 'A' for ascending order or 'D' for descending order.  
After you have entered a valid filename, the system will print out the sorted words and ask you if you wish to have the new sorted words saved as a new txt file.  
If you select yes, the program will save the new sorted file as "'name you entered'_sorted_(order of sorting).txt" in the same folder sortLenAlph.py is currently in.  
The program will then ask if you wish to enter another filename to be sorted.  
If you select yes, the process will start over. If you select no, the program will close. 





Test data: 
>There are two pre-made txt files in the repository for you to test with. "Sort Me.txt" and "pokemon.txt".  
To test the program, download the txt files into the same location as you did sortLenAlph.py prior to running the program.  
Then type in the aforementioned filenames to get them back sorted.
